                    I'm currently in a mentorship program with Emergent Works learning web development & computer programming skills. I am studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NODE, Parcel, & React.  <a href="https://www.emergentworks.org/"> www.emergentworks.org.</a>

                    My passions include social and environmental justice. I am currently building an app for a project in my mentorship program called Not911. This app will help citizens in the San Francisco Bay Area find emergency resources for issues ranging from violence, mental health, drug overdose, and more. My goal is to help provide resources so that our community members no longer have to rely on the police for assistance in situations where their presence is likely to result in unnecessary violence against innocent citizens. The ultimate goal is to defund the police and re-allocate those resources to more effective public services.

                    In my past, I worked as a professional gardener for Continuum Gardens in Seattle, WA. When I lived in San Cristobal de las Casas in Chiapas, Mexico 2009-2010, I made my living as a silversmith selling handmade jewelry. I enjoy amateur photography and love taking photos while I travel. You can see more about all of this and the work I have done as a web developer in this websiteâ€™s projects section.
