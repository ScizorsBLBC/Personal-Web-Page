                    In my past I have done creative work as a professional gardener for Continuum Gardens in Seattle WA, and as a silversmith while I lived in San Cristobal del las Casas, Chiapas, Mexico in 2009-2010.  I enjoy amateur photography and love to take photos while I travel.  You can see more about all of this and the work I have done as a web developer in the projects section of this website.
